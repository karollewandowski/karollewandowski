### Greetings from [BiaÅ‚ystok, Poland](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bia%C5%82ystok/@53.1275431,23.0159837,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x471ffc048f41971d:0x72317dcc8bf07b2c!8m2!3d53.1324886!4d23.1688403) ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karol, and I have been a professional software developer since 2010. I'm fortunate to do what I love for a living.

For most of my career, I was focused on developing applications related to Adobe Experience Manager, Apache Sling, and IntelliJ Platform. My main programming languages are Java and Kotlin.

Currently, I work at JetBrains as a Developer Advocate focusing on improving the IntelliJ Platform plugins development experience.

I had an opportunity to contribute to open-source projects as:

- [IntelliJ Community](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-community)
- [IntelliJ Platform Plugin SDK Documentation](https://github.com/JetBrains/intellij-sdk-docs)
- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [AEM Mocks](https://wcm.io/testing/aem-mock/)
- [HTL Specification](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec)

However, **the project I'm the proudest of is [AEM IDE](https://aemide.com)** - IntelliJ Platform plugin supporting Adobe Experience Manager applications development.
If you are an AEM developer, I will be pleased if you give it a try and let me know what you think.

Have a wonderful day ðŸ¤©

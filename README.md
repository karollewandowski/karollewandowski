### Greetings from BiaÅ‚ystok, Poland ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karol, and I have been a professional software developer since 2010. I'm fortunate to do what I love for a living.

I'm focused on developing applications related to Adobe Experience Manager, Apache Sling, and IntelliJ Platform. My main programming languages are Java and Kotlin.

I had an opportunity to contribute to open-source projects as:

- [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)
- [AEM Mocks](https://wcm.io/testing/aem-mock/)
- [HTL Specification](https://github.com/adobe/htl-spec)

However, the project I am the proudest of is [AEM IDE](https://aemide.com) - IntelliJ Platform plugin supporting Adobe Experience Manager applications development.

Have a wonderful day ðŸ¤©
